### Hi, I'm Matthew! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Duke University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. My thesis is on mixing times of tempered Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC). I am also collaborating on projects with the Renyi Institute of Mathematics and the Duke Economic Analytics Lab. I previously have worked with the Duke Topological Learning Lab and the Duke Open Design Studio.

I've previously interned in Quant Trading, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Product Management roles. I'm current working at Bridgewater Associates as an Investment Engineer Intern.
