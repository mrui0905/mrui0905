### Hi, I'm Matthew! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about quantitatively seeking a better understanding of the world and building technologies for a more sustainable and equitable future!
I'm currently studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics at Duke University and exploring machine learning, web3, and quantitative finance in my free time.
You'll also catch me at the tennis courts and exploring the Rocky Mountains of my home state Colorado.

I can be contacted via matthew.rui@duke.edu or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewrui/).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently:
- Working with the FBI and Violence Project to study and model the local effects mass shootings have on gun sales and further community deaths.
- Researching Markov Chain mixing times and efficient Monte Carlo Algorithms with Dr. Scott Schmidler.
- Investigating neural network behavior, applying novel neuroscience methods to better understand GANs.

ðŸ•• In the past, I've:
- Placed 1st at Citadel's 2023 Summer Invitational Datathon utilizing regression models, random forest regressors, SCMs, and Difference-In-Difference models. 
- Created a private investment blockchain to facilitate ICO fundraisings and efficient dividend payments.
- Collaborated with educators across the U.S. to design a more ethical and inclusive introductory CS curriculum currently used in 7 high schools. 

ðŸ§  I'm interested in learning more about:
- Machine Learning and how it can be used to create technology to level the playing field and decrease inequality in the US.
- Quantitative trading methods/algorithms and how to more perfectly model the unpredictability in the financial markets.
- Game theory and how technology and societal systems can be efficiently optimized.

Feel free to reach out whenever! I'm excited to learn more about all things technology.
