### Hi, I'm Matthew! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student at Duke University double majoring in Computer Science (AI/ML Concentration) and Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. My research is advised by Dr. Scott Schmidler. I am also collaborating on projects with the Renyi Institute of Mathematics (Budapest, Hungary) and the Duke Economic Analytics Lab. I previously have worked with the Duke Topological Learning Lab and the Duke Open Design Studio.

I've previously interned in Quant Trading, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Product Management roles. I will be joining Bridgewater Associates in a Quant Research role for Summer 2025.
