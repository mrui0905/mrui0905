### Hi, I'm Matthew! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about quantitatively seeking a better understanding of the world and building technologies for a more sustainable and equitable future!
I'm currently studying Computer Science, Mathematics, and Finance at Duke University and exploring machine learning, web3, and quantitative finance in my free time.
You'll also catch me at the tennis courts and exploring the Rocky Mountains of my home state Colorado.

I can be contacted via matthew.rui@duke.edu or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewrui/).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently:
- Working with the FBI and Violence Project to study and model the local effects mass shootings have on gun sales and further community deaths.
- Taking a graduate-level math course in Stochastic Calculus to better understand portfolio construction and Brownian motion.
- Developing a prototype private blockchain used to tokenize equity in private investment funds.

ðŸ•• In the past, I've:
- Modeled Monopoly and created machine learning models to optimize "aggression style" to maximize win percentage.
- Collaborated with educators across the U.S. to design a more ethical and inclusive introductory CS curriculum currently used in 7 high schools. 
- Competed in classical piano internationally and ranked nationally in policy debate, specializing in sustainability issues.

ðŸ§  I'm interested in learning more about:
- Machine Learning and how it can be used to create technology to level the playing field and decrease inequality in the US.
- Quantitative trading methods/algorithms and how to more perfectly model the unpredictability in the financial markets.
- Game theory and how technology and societal systems can be efficiently optimized.

Feel free to reach out whenever! I'm excited to learn more about all things technology.
